My name is Kenny Nguyen, I'm 21, and I am a cybersecurity professional with experience in offensive security and VAPT. I graduated with a master's degree in cybersecurity during 2021 at WGU. Then I got my OSCP a few months after that and got my current position at a consulting firm. I am passionate and interested in offensive security research including:
- Network Security
- Web Application Security
- Industrial Control System Security
- Red Teaming 
- Exploit Development
- Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering

I am creating this technical research blog to share my journey as I explore security topics, vulnerabilities, techniques, and etc.
